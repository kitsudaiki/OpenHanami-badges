# OpenHanami-badges

Contains the badges for the Readme of https://github.com/kitsudaiki/OpenHanami

Info: This was moved into this dedicated repository and not stored in the OpenHanami-repo itself, to restrict the access of the github token, which is used by the CI-pipeline to push new badges to a location, where they can be read by the Readme. In case you know a cleaner way to provide badges with status-information of single matrix jobs without additional uploads like this repo here, then please create an QA-issue in https://github.com/kitsudaiki/OpenHanami and let me know, how you would solve this problem.
